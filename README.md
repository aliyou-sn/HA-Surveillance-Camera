<h3 align="center">AI-Based-Surveillance-Camera</h3>

This is an AI based surveillance camera with object detection, based on ESP 32 CAM module (AI-Thinker), a model train with edge impulse for survellance and detecting human being in a given area.The main aim of the system is to understand how many people are in an area, in othr to control the air conditioner and luminance in that area.For now, I was able to achieve the object detection and surveillance, moving forward to energy conservation with it.

**Features**

1. Object detection
2. Edge AI
